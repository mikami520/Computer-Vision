Here is the testing result of two models. From the tabel, nnUNet got 0.65 for average dice score and VoxelMorph got 0.43. Highest score of nnUnet is approaching to 0.9 while Voxelmorph is closed to 0.7. This result is not perfect but rational since nnUNet learns powerful representations for pixel-wise predictions but Voxelmorph is a registration-based algorithm which needs much more information to obtain the nonlinear correspondence between two 3D image volumes and deform the topologies to the target images as a means of segmentation. With same number of dataset, segmentation network reasonably has better performance than the registration network. Next is a visualization for one testing result. left is the overlay of prediction and ground truth on the test scan. Right is the heatmap to represent the difference between ground truth and prediction. For the future development, we had three directions. First is to collect more labeled data which will provide more information for model to learn. Second is to change the network architecture like adding some residual units or modifying the layers of encoder and decoder.
Third is changing some hyper-premeters like optimizer, loss function and so on.
